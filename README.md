**PS**: art_gallery.sql file is incomplete. As I had forgotten to upload this file when I added this project and got to know when few people approached me while using this project from github. Since its an old project which I was done during 3rd year of college along with my friends, I couldn't get the final schema but only got this incomplete one in my system. 

Also I have added, few files related to this project which can we useful to people using this project. These files are contributed by [github.com/txhniyx](https://github.com/txhniyx). But there are few modifications which she did while making this project work.

If anyone is interested to update this project with all working code feel free to file a pull request.
